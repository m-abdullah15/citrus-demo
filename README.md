## 📖 About the Project

CitrusInsight AI classifies citrus leaf images into **10 disease categories**, helping farmers quickly identify and manage citrus plant diseases.

Our system is built as a web application where users can upload an image and instantly get predictions.

## 🌟 Key Features

- ✅ Citrus leaf disease classification (10 classes)
- ✅ Image upload and disease prediction
- ✅ Performance reporting (Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix)
- ✅ User-friendly web interface
- ✅ Dataset of **5,859 images** (labeled)

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is divided into:
- **Training set:** `F:\citrus_diseases_dataset\train`
- **Validation set:** `F:\citrus_diseases_dataset\val`
- **Test set:** `F:\citrus_diseases_dataset\test`

**Classes:**
Citrus Canker, Citrus Greening, Citrus Mealybugs, Die Back, Foliage Damaged, Healthy Leaf, Powdery Mildew, Shot Hole, Spiny Whitefly, Yellow Leaves.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn)
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript / PHP** (Frontend + Backend)
- **XAMPP Server**
- **VS Code IDE**
