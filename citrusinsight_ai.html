      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>CitrusInsight AI is an AI-powered citrus leaf disease detection system designed to assist citrus farmers by detecting diseases from leaf images. Our project utilizes machine learning models to classify leaves into 10 different disease categories.</p>

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Citrus leaf disease classification (10 classes)</li>
        <li>Image upload and disease prediction interface</li>
        <li>Performance metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix</li>
        <li>Web-based, accessible via browser</li>
      </ul>
